# ðŸŒ€ Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM) on General Geometries

We study Riemannian Flow Matching on Stacked-MNIST, CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet-200 using hyperspherical, hyperbolic, and toroidal latent manifolds, each equipped with an autoencoder and classifier.

The main content is placed in the master branch.
